                London is the capital and largest city of England and the United Kingdom. 
                Standing on the River Thames in the south-east of England, at the head of its 50-mile (80 km) estuary leading to the North Sea, 
                London has been a major settlement for two millennia. Londinium was founded by the Romans. The City of London, 
                London's ancient core − an area of just 1.12 square miles (2.9 km2) and colloquially known as the Square Mile 
                − retains boundaries that follow closely its medieval limits. The City of Westminster is also an Inner London borough 
                holding city status. Greater London is governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.
                London is considered to be one of the world's most important global cities and has been termed the world's most powerful,
                 most desirable, most influential, most visited, most expensive, innovative, sustainable, most investment friendly, 
                 and most popular for work city in the world. London exerts a considerable impact upon the arts, commerce, education, 
                 entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism and transportation. 
                 London ranks 26 out of 300 major cities for economic performance. It is one of the largest financial centres and has either the fifth or sixth largest metropolitan area GDP.
                  It is the most-visited city as measured by international arrivals and has the busiest city airport system as measured by passenger traffic.

                    London, the capital of the United Kingdom and largest city in the United Kingdom, has a temperate oceanic climate, with mild summers and cool winters. While the city annually has modest precipitation, there are long periods of overcast skies and frequent light mist-type precipitation, which may account for the rainy image of the city. Nevertheless, London averages about 1600 hours of sunshine annually, which is comparable with most European capitals. Like much of the U.K., the climate of London is shaped by the onshore flow of the high latitude Atlantic Ocean, which brings moist, cool air, and frequent cloudy skies.
                    <br/><br/>
                    Within the current boundaries of Greater London, the coldest temperature ever recorded was −16.1 °C (3.0 °F) at Northolt in January 1962, and the highest temperature ever recorded was 38.1 °C (100.6 °F), recorded at Kew Gardens during the European Heat Wave of 2003. London's large built-up area creates a microclimate (an "urban heat island"), with heat stored by the city's buildings. Sometimes temperatures are 5 °C (9 °F) warmer in the city than in the surrounding areas. The urban heat island effect creates a microclimate in inner London, as seen in the London weather centre climate table below.
